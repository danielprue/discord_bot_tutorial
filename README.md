# Discord Bot Tutorial
This repository is for learning how to get started with writing bots for Discord. 
My main audience here is going to be people who have some familiarity with programming in JS, especially those who have experience with React/Express, but these steps should be pretty easy to pick up for anyone with any basic understanding of coding.
I will link below any prerequisites to getting started. Any individual directory here will assume you are working with these resources.

# Resources
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -- If you prefer another IDE, this is not required
* [Discord](https://discord.com/) -- You must have a discord account, and a discord server on which you have server management permissions (you may have to create a new server for this)

# Current Tutorials
1. [Basic Bot](/basic_bot) -- A beginner's tutorial for your first discord bot
2. [Bot Deployment](./bot_hosting) -- Use Heroku to deploy your bot for free

# Future Tutorials -- To Be Written
1. Making API calls
